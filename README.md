Once a photo is clicked on a card will appear with a larger version of the photo and a list of other similar photos underneath it. The user can favorite the photo from this card too.

The user can also look at pictures that have been grouped in categories by clicking on the categories in the top navigation bar. If they want to go back to having all of the pictures displayed they can click on the Photolabs logo.
